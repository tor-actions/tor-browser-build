The issue's title MUST provide a succinct description of the problem.

Some good (hypothetical) titles:
- Required perl dependency missing from debian repositories
- Tor Browser macOS builds not reproducible
- Intermittent failure running make fetch

Please DO NOT include information about platform in the title, it is redundant
with our labeling system!
