### Updating Gradle Dependencies
If additional Android dependencies are required by the project's build, then
the Gradle build will fail due to missing dependencies. To find out what the
missing dependencies are take the following steps.

1) Updating gradle dependencies for `application-services`

The following makefile rules can be used:

  make get_gradle_dependencies_list-application-services

which should create the gradle-dependencies-list.txt files in the
corresponding out/$project directory, using nightly's branch.


2) Updating gradle dependencies for `geckoview`

The `geckoview` project doesn't have (yet) a makefile rule to generate the
gradle-dependencies-list.txt file, so a few more steps are needed.

For the geckoview project, comment out the following line in the project's
build_common file:

   export GRADLE_MAVEN_REPOSITORIES="file://$gradle_repo","file://$gradle_repo/maven2"

Also modify the gradle flags to include the debug option so the download logs will show up:

   export GRADLE_FLAGS="--no-daemon --debug"

Otherwise, when calling gradle in the project's build script replace the
`--offline` flag with `--debug` and remove any `-Dmaven.repo.local` arguments.

Finally, allow network access during the build by setting
`container/disable_network/build` to `0` in rbm.conf, and rerun the build.

Dependent artifacts will show up as downloads in the logs. You can pull out
these dependencies into a list by passing the log file to the gradle dependency
list script in the projects/common directory:

`projects/common/gen_gradle_deps_file.sh /path/to/log/file`


3) Copying the resulting `gradle-dependencies-list.txt`

Copy the resulting `gradle-dependencies-list.txt` (from step 1. or 2.)
over the one in the respective project. Then, in the project's config
file, increment the `var/gradle_dependencies_version` and make sure to
restore the project's build file back to original if you modified it.
