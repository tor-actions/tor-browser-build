#!/usr/bin/env ./Browser/execdesktop
#
# This file is a self-modifying .desktop file that can be run from the shell.
# It preserves arguments and environment for the start-[% c("var/project-name") %] script.
#
# Run './start-[% c("var/project-name") %].desktop --help' to display the full set of options.
#
# When invoked from the shell, this file must always be in a [% c("var/Project_Name") %] root
# directory. When run from the file manager or desktop GUI, it is relocatable.
#
# After first invocation, it will update itself with the absolute path to the
# current [% c("var/Project_Name") %] location, to support relocation of this .desktop file for GUI
# invocation. You can also add [% c("var/Project_Name") %] to your desktop's application menu
# by running './start-[% c("var/project-name") %].desktop --register-app'
#
# If you use --register-app, and then relocate your [% c("var/Project_Name") %] directory, [% c("var/Project_Name") %]
# will no longer launch from your desktop's app launcher/dock. However, if you
# re-run --register-app from inside that new directory, the script
# will correct the absolute paths and re-register itself.
#
# This file will also still function if the path changes when [% c("var/Project_Name") %] is used as a
# portable app, so long as it is run directly from that new directory, either
# via the shell or via the file manager.
