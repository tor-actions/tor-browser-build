[Glean](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/glean/glean.html) is Mozilla's
telemetry framework. Mozilla provides SDKs for various programming languages.
This project only exists to build the Glean Kotlin SDK.

The Glean SDKs are all based on a common Rust library which contains the core
functionality of it. The Kotlin part of the code is mostly auto generated by uniffi.

This project builds the Glean Kotlin SDK using a custom uniffi generator for Kotlin,
which only generates no-ops -- same one used by application-services for most of
it's components (see: projects/uniffi-rs).

This approach disables all of Glean's functionality at build time, while also
dropping a few megabytes off of Tor Browser's APK by allowing it to not package
the Glean Rust library at all.
