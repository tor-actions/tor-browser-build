This file is used by tools/list-unused-projects to find projects which
are being used. The script is looking at which projects are being used
when processing projects/release/build (recusively). However some
projects are not being used in the build itself but are still being
used or need to be kept. We are listing those projects here.

- mmdebstrap ([% pc('mmdebstrap', 'version') %]) and mmdebstrap-image
  ([% pc('mmdebstrap-image', 'version') %]) are used as part of the
  build, but are not found as a dependency when no container needs to be
  rebuilt (container-image filenames do not depend on mmdebstrap)

- lox-wasm is ([% pc('lox-wasm', 'version') %]) is not yet used in the
  build, but will be at some point

- wasm-bindgen ([% pc('wasm-bindgen', 'version') %]) is a dependency of
  lox-wasm

- osslsigncode ([% pc('osslsigncode', 'version') %]), rcodesign
  ([% pc('rcodesign', 'version') %]) and yubihsm-shell
  ([% pc('yubihsm-shell', 'version') %]) are used by the
  signing scripts

- mar-tools ([% pc('mar-tools', 'version') %]) is used by
  tools/setup-martools and the signing scripts.
